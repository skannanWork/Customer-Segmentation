# Customer-Segmentation
First, you need to obtain a dataset of customer data. The customer data used was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/). Upon obtaining the data, the program cleans the data by handling missing values. This program loads the customer data into a Pandas DataFrame, selects the features, and standardizes the data using the StandardScaler. It then creates the segments using K-Means clustering and assigns the segments to the customers. Finally, it prints the resulting segments.

Programs like this are useful for businesses as they can get a better look at the type of customers they are getting
